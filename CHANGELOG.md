# Changelog

Merged work, newest first. Times are ET.

## 2026-09-25

- **#4 Status panel** (merged 06:13). `docs/status/` renders `docs/status.json`: per-state counts,
  task cards, and a coverage timeline. All values go in via `textContent`. `?demo` loads a fixture built
  by `status.py` from a synthetic log. Handles missing and malformed files. Ships the fixture only; no
  real-log status file is committed.
- **#3 Status view v1** (merged 04:41). Optional `repo` field on tasks. `tools/status.py` builds
  `docs/status.json` fail-closed: `publish_repos` allowlist (case-insensitive), every message needs a
  trip in `publish_trips` (the bridge's own included), and an empty list publishes nothing. Both
  bridges take an optional `pass` so they can have a trip. 13 unit tests in `tools/test_status.py`.
  The design came from alex's knowledge-graph idea, worked through with Fuse.
- **#2 Landing page** (merged 03:41). `docs/index.html` plus `docs/landing.css` at the GitHub Pages
  root, linking to the client already published at `docs/muse/`.
- **#1 Client auto-reconnect** (merged 03:41). Exponential backoff with jitter (1 s → 30 s). Immediate
  retry when the tab becomes visible or the browser comes back online. A rejected join no longer leaves
  the client showing "connected" outside the channel. Review nits from Fuse applied.

## 2026-09-24

- Initial relay: `Chief.Bridge` (.NET 8) desktop bridge, `web/muse` browser client, `docs/protocol.md`,
  the legacy Python bridge under `legacy/python/`, and the client published on Pages at `docs/muse/`.
